Firebrick-Session-Monitor
=========================

Shows you session information by polling your Firebrick session XML file

Nothing much to see here yet. 

This is a placeholder for a project I want to start. Mostly as an experiment with node.js.

Hopefully it will be able to do this

* Poll and parse the session XML file that the Firebrick holds
* Save the data in MongoDB
* Show a nice overview of each IP address on the network and where it connects to
* Show a summary of how much data each IP uses
* Show a historical graph over data used by each IP
* Keep a retention period of a few days in the database
